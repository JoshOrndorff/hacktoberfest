## How do I claim to be working on an issue or ticket

For any of the bigger issues listed in this repository, please submit a draft-PR tagging the issue number and continue commiting or commenting within that PR to show progress. A PR that is stale for more than 10 days might be closed without further warning and the the issue is up for grabs again. Once you are ready for review, please switch the draft PR to ready for review and we'll get right on that.

For any issue posted elsewhere just post a comment asking to be assigned for the task, mentioning either the mentor (if known) or the original author of the ticket in your comment. They will then assign the ticket to you. Here, too, we recommend keeping the mentor/author up to date on what is happening or they might re-assign the ticket later.
